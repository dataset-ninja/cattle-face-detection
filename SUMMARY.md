**Cattle Face Detection** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the livestock industry.

The dataset consists of 237 images with 237 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*bovine*).

Each image in the Cattle Face Detection dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (10 images), *valid* (20 images), and *train* (207 images). The dataset was released in 2023 by the [Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Brazil](https://www.ufsm.br/).

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
